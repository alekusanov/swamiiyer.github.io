The writeup file contains the problem descriptions. The zip file contains the starter files for the problems, any data files, and `notes.txt` file for projects.

### Grading Scheme

#### Correctness and Style

Your solution to each exercise/project problem will be evaluated by an autograder for correctness and style. Each test that is used to evaluate the correctness of your solution is worth some number of points; your solution will receive all the points from a test that passes and 0 points from a test that does not pass. Your solution will receive 2 points if there are no style errors, and 0 points otherwise. Your overall correctness and style score will be normalized to 100 points for an exercise and 80 points for a project.

#### Clarity and Efficiency

Your solution to each project problem will additionally be checked by a TA for clarity and efficiency. Your code will receive 20 points if it meets our expectations (must include adequate comments, must follow good programming principles, and must meet any problem-specific requirements such as corner cases and running times), and marked down otherwise.

#### Notes File

For a project, the given `notes.txt` file must be uploaded with the four sections (1 and 2 mandatory, 3 if applicable, and 4 optional) filled in as appropriate. Failing to do so will cost you one point.

### Submitting Your Work

You will use [Gradescope](https://gradescope.com/) to submit your Python programs (ie, `.py` files). Make sure that you only submit files listed under the *Files to Submit* section of the assignment writeup.

You may submit your files as many times as you like, up until the assignment deadline. The most recent submission is considered *active* by default and your score on the active submission is your official score for the assignment as well. You have the option of making any of your previous submissions active.

Note: If your active submission is partial, your assignment score will also be partial, so in order to be eligible for full credit, make sure you have an active submission containing all the required files for the assignment. 

Before you submit your programs, make sure that they meet the coding style. You may check a program, for example `helloworld.py`, for coding style by running the following command on the terminal:

```
$ pycodestyle helloworld.py
```
