Dear student,

Welcome to the Introduction to Computing (CS110) course I will be teaching this semester!

- Please make sure that you meet the prerequisites for the course: Math 140 credits or placement; or Math 130 with a B or higher in the previous semester; or permission of the instructor. 

- Please read through the [course website](/cs110/) very carefully and acquaint yourself with the course mechanics.

- Please take care of the following action items:
  - Follow up on the invitations sent to your UMB email address to sign up for:
      - Piazza (Q&A platform) and
      - Gradescope (grading platform).
  - Setup the [programming environment](/public/cs110/ipp_programming_environment_setup.pdf) on your computer.
  - Fill out the questionnaire available on Gradescope.
  - Complete the [Supplemental Instruction (SI) poll](https://forms.gle/XcWogCwBTb2z92aQ9).
  - Sign up for a [CS account](course_info.html#cs_account).

- CS110 is a very demanding course, so please be prepared to work really hard from the outset, or else you will quickly fall behind and end up with a poor/failing grade.

- If you are currently wait-listed and relatively high on the list, or would like to register, please be patient and show up for classes during the first week. I'll do my best to enroll you in before the add/drop deadline.

- <font color="red">NOTE: During the first week we will only meet for lectures. Discussions and SI sessions will start from the second week, ie, the week of Sep 12.</font>

I look forward to having you in my class.

Best,

Swami
