Dear student,

Welcome to the Compilers (CS451/651) course I will be teaching this semester!

- Please make sure that you meet the prerequisites for the course: CS310 and CS420 or CS622; or permission of the instructor. 

- Please read through the [course website](/cs451/) very carefully and acquaint yourself with the course mechanics.

- Please take care of the following action items:
  - Sign up for [iClicker](https://app.reef-education.com/\#/account/create iClicker) (attendance platform) using your UMB email address and add the course *CS451/651* to your dashboard.
  - Follow up on the invitations that will be sent to your UMB email address to sign up for:
      - Piazza (Q&A platform) and
      - Gradescope (grading platform).
  - Setup the [programming environment](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~siyer/teaching/cs451/cc_programming_environment_setup.pdf) on your computer.
  - Fill out the questionnaire available on Gradescope.
  - Sign up for a [CS account](course_info.html#cs_account).

- CS451/651 is a very demanding course, so please be prepared to work really hard from the outset, or else you will quickly fall behind and end up with a poor/failing grade.

- If you are currently waitlisted, you will be enrolled automatically if enough students drop out before the add/drop deadline. The enrollment capacity is set at 30 for CS451 and 20 for CS651. If one course is over-enrolled (ie, there are students on the waitlist) while the other has free seats, I will enroll as many waitlisted students from the former into the latter, in the order of their waitlist number. Please note that I will **not** go over the total enrollment capacity of 50.

I look forward to having you in my class.

Best,

Swami
