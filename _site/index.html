<h3>Biography</h3>

<p>I was born in the southern Indian city of Chennai and grew up in Mumbai. I received my primary and secondary education at <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/JIxgN">Model English School</a> and higher secondary education at <a href="http://www.ruparel.edu/">Ruparel College</a>. During my second year at Ruparel College, I attended the famous (now defunct) <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Coaching-centre-downs-shutters-after-57-years/articleshow/7187553.cms">Agrawal Classes</a>. I received my bachelor&#39;s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from <a href="https://mu.ac.in">University of Mumbai</a> in 1996 after which I worked for two years as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.tatainteractive.com/">Tata Interactive Systems</a>, where I designed and implemented multimedia-rich e-learning software. I received my master&#39;s degree in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.umb.edu">University of Massachusetts at Boston (UMB)</a> in 2001, following which I worked at <a href="http://www.bmcsoftware.com/">BMC Software</a> as a product developer until 2006. My role at BMC Software was to design and develop system- and application-level performance-monitoring software. I then decided to seek a doctoral degree in order to fulfill my ambition of pursuing a career in academia with both research and teaching responsibilities. I received my PhD in Comptuer Science, also from UMB, in 2013. My thesis, entitled <a href="http://scholarworks.umb.edu/doctoral_dissertations/113">Evolutionary Dynamics on Complex Networks</a>, was directed by Prof. Timothy Killingback from the Mathematics Department.</p>
