title: Teaching
---

Throughout my student life I had the good fortune of being taught by some exceptional teachers. I not only learned a lot from them, but also developed a keen interest in sharing my knowledge — however little that may be — with others the way in which my instructors did. The great physicist [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman) once remarked, ‘‘I find that teaching and the students keep life going, and I would never accept any position in which somebody has invented a happy situation for me where I don't have to teach. Never.’’ I feel exactly the same way about teaching.
